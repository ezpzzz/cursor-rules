##  MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST 
STOP! Before writing ANY code or suggesting ANY changes:

1. üîç SEARCH FIRST:
   ```bash
   # REQUIRED: Run these searches to learn more about relevant code/files and document results
   grep_search for functionality
   file_search for similar files
   list_dir in relevant directories
   ```

2. üìù DOCUMENT FINDINGS:
   ```markdown
   # REQUIRED: Fill this out
   ## Existing Files Found:

   ## Existing Functionality:
   - [Describe what already exists]
   
   ## Gaps Identified:
   - [List what's missing or needs enhancement]

  ## Use @Web tool:
   - Find relevent documentation online to aid in your approach
   
   ## Proposed Approach:
   - [ ] Enhance existing code
   - [ ] Create new files (requires justification)
   - [ ] Refactor existing code
   - [ ] Test the new/refactored code
   ```

3. ‚úã WAIT FOR APPROVAL:
   - Present findings to user
